# Carats and Cake Engineering Exercise

Carat's product team manages both the business and customer facing features of our payments platform. At the core of our work is the understanding and implementation of full stack web development principles and best practices.

We've designed this take home to get a sense of how you think and work as a developer. There is no one way to solve for the prompt below, but make sure to read this document thoroughly to understand how to succeed.

## Before you start

It is not our intent for this exercise to consume a great deal of your time, but to serve as a topic of discussion for your next interview. Please do not spend more than two or three hours on this work.

Optionaly, feel free to write a TODO section in the README for things you would have liked to get to with more time.

We primarily use React and Rails, but feel free to use whatever languages and frameworks you are most comfortable with.

## Prompt

Create a small web app which can:

- Collect billing information through a form and stores it as encrypted data in a database.
- Display a list of billing information (decrypted).

Requirements:

1. The app should serve a billing address form UI with the following fields:

- Name
- Email address
- Phone number (US)
- Street Address
- City
- State
- Zip

2. Provide reasonable validation and error feedback for the fields, and provide a success page or message on successful form submission.
3. In a separate view, display a list of submitted billing addresses from the database (decrypted).
4. Add the amount of test coverage you feel is appropriate for the scope of this application (and be prepared to talk to testing choices made).
5. Provide a README.md with one or both of the following:

- Instructions on how to run the app locally.
- A link to the app if hosted on Heroku or similar

## Getting started

1. Create a new project repo, separate from this one. Please keep project in a monorepo for ease of review.
2. Please keep both the frontend and web server in this monorepo for us to review.

## When done

Send your hiring contact a link to your project repository.
