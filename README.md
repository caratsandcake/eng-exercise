# Carats and Cake Engineering Exercise

## Before you start
It is not our intent for this exercise to consume a great deal of your time, but to serve as a topic of discussion for your next interview. Please do not spend more than two to four hours on this work. Optionaly, feel free to write a TODO section in the README for things you would have liked to get to with more time.

When done, send your hiring contact a link to your project repository.

## Prompt

Create a small web app which can:
  - Collect billing information through a form and stores it as **encrypted data** in a database.
  - Display a list of billing information (decrypted).
  
This exercise is meant to measure your fundamental programming skills, not your knowledge of an individual stack. Use whichever frameworks or languages you feel the most comfortable using to solving the exercise.

Requirements:

1. The app should serve a billing address form UI with the following fields:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Phone number (US)
    - Street Address
    - City
    - State
    - Zip

2. Provide reasonable validation and error feedback for the fields, and provide a success page or message on successful form submission.
3. In a separate view, display a list of submitted billing addresses from the database (decrypted).
4. Add the amount of test coverage you feel is appropriate for the scope of this application (and be prepared to talk to testing choices made).
5. Provide a README.md with the following:
    - Instructions on how to run the app locally.

## Getting started

1. Create a new project repo, separate from this one. Please keep project in a monorepo for ease of review.
2. Please keep both the frontend and web server in this monorepo for us to review.
